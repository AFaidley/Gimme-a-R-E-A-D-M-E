## Description
This app will allow the user to generate a ReadMe through node/terminal.
## Technology Used
- Javascript
- Node
- Inquirer
## Installation
The user would need to install Node, the following link describes how to do so: https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs <br> After installing Node they will then have to install the required packages and they can do so by using the command "npm i" in the terminal.
## Usage
To use my application the user will have to open the terminal and type in node index.js and press enter. Once they have done so they will be prompted with a series of questions based on what information will be shown on the ReadMe. Upon completing all of  the questions a ReadMe.md file will be created and the user can open it and make any further adjustments if required, or use it as they please. Thank you for using my app!
